        <p>Welcome to this Web application</p>
        <p>We aim to please</p>
        <h2>The project we are going to make this semster</h2>
        <p>So in our system development class, we found a cilent that tasked us with the creation of a website for his glasses business.</p>
        <p>The client has a website that displays information, but they want an overhaul of it, in which they will be able to sell their glasses online.</p>
        <p>They want a login system for users and an admin login, which will allow them to control their inventory and manage the users. </p>
        <p>The developer who's working with the business before we did will provide us with a database of their stocks that will be used to display their items.  </p>
